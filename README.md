# Range-Tree

A data structure used for range queries. It uses Balanced binary search tree for set of data points in n-dimensional space. 

# Properties

-> It stores data in leaf nodes in a sorted manner.
-> Every internal node in n-dimensional space stores an associated tree.

# Implementation

We have implemented 1D and 2D range tree to process a sample COVID-19 data obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus.

# Presenation
